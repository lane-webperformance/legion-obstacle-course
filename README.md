Obstacle Course
---------------

Legion's Obstacle Course is a simple express.js server. Included are a variety
of practice tasks. These tasks can be used to test Legion's functionality or
as training tasks for new users.

Get detailed [documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.txt) about the tasks by
requesting / from the server.

Start the server by running:

	npm start

or run it programatically from within another library by calling:

	require('legion-obstacle-course').listen(port);

The arguments and return value for listen() are exactly the same
as the express.js method of the same name.
